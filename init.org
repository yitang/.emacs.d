The road to Emacs is not easy: I have tried to use Emacs for many
years, and started using on daily basis from Jun 2014. The transition
is difficulty, and full of tears and bloody, and every day I feel like
being doomed in the dark. About Jan 2015, I start to the light. and
conquered Emacs, and it now becomes a symbol of me, and I use it do
most of productive work.

As the configuration grows bigger and bigger, a single /init.el/ is
not suitable for organising, testing, and expanding anymore.
Previously, I have about 7 =.el= files, for example, =setup-org.el=,
=setup-email.el=, and I document on each file. Inpisraed by Sachua's
new posts, I think it would be an brilliant idea to org Emacs
configuration code into one single org file, letting along the
conviencen of orgnising and share my seetting, the precious thing I
would appreciate is it provide an way I could start with a long
comments, thoughts or workflow. in this way, the code becomes less
important as it should be.

my configration file is initally seaprated by differnt purpose or
mode, but as it gorwths, it bcaem inconicient in tracking, and, As for
other Emacs user, my configration is keep growthing, and This
documents is first combined by 5 configration files, and it keep
expanding, I use liteature programming to includes all the notes, and
keep a log of how I use themn

This Emacs configuration is free of bug and fully tested on Ubuntu and
OS X.

Normally you could tangle a org file to extract all the source code
into one file, that you could use. But I would like to push liteartpr
programming furture in two aspects: 1) the source code takes input
from this org file, I.e. table. 2) it facility Babel Library to
integrate not only Emacs Lisp, but also sh and R functions that could
be run in Emacs, and I found it particullary useful.

major Emacs repositories. it is recommended to install them via Emacs's
package management tool, and by the following snippets. Note the
initial installation may takes a while to finish, depends on how many
are already in the /~/emacs.d/elpa// folder.

Define an auto-save feature, the backup files are saved in

most recent, but un-saved version, after power off.

convenient and faster than actually locate the file path.

yasnippet is a powerful package that I'd like to explore in the

*** Window Layout/Navigation 
[2015-01-19 Mon 12:13]
    
Quickly jump between windows using =ace-window=, I used it frequently and
bind it ~F1~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(require 'ace-window)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f2>") 'ace-window)

Instead of equally split the window size, it make a lot sense to have
the current window, the one I am working one, has bigger size.

(require 'golden-ratio)
(golden-ratio-mode 1)
(add-to-list 'golden-ratio-extra-commands 'ace-window) ;; active golden ratio when using ace-window
#+end_src

Some actions will add/remove windows, and sometimes I'd like to cycle
tough the window layout/changes. In the following settings, =C-c
<left>= to undo window layout changes, and =C-c <right>= to redo.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(winner-mode 1)
;; winner-undo -> C-c <left>
;; winner-redo -> C-c <right>
#+end_src

I'd like to use two frames, one for doing and logging, and other for
reference/searching.

*** General Editing  

There are a set of characters that are more likely to occur as a pair,
for example, quote and brackets. /smartparens mode/ allows me to
define such set of pairing characters.

;; |foobar
;; hit C-(

It is a terrible idea to have lines of context that expand the whole
screen, especially nowadays we have wide-screens, which just make it is
hard to read. A well accepted rule is to set the width of lines to 80
characters, and force a logical line breaks. This funcitonality is
called =auto-fill= in Emacs, and I can do the filling by call =fill-paragraph=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill) ;;

Just in case I need to reverse the auto-fill process.

I use the Adobe's /Source Code Pro/ font, it is Monospaced font and
claimed to be suitable for coding environments. But I use it for all modes.

*** Minimalists GUI 
[2015-07-20 Mon 11:46]

I never click any buttons in the menu-bar/tool-bar, nor need the
scroll-bar to tell me the cursor position the in the buffer, so I removed all of
them to have minimalist GUI of Emacs.

*** Theme 
[2015-07-20 Mon 11:46]

I have been using /zenburn/ theme for a while. It is a popular low contrast
colour theme and easy on the eye. Occasionally I apply /tsdh-dark/
theme on the top when I really need to focus on.

*** Mode Line

[2015-07-20 Mon 11:46]

The mode line is at the bottom of every Emacs Window aside from
MiniBuffer windows. It has most of the relevant information about the buffer,
including Git status, Major mode, clock info, etc. 

The smart-mode-line packages can make mode-line "smart and sexy".
There are many options to tweak.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent :eval no
(require 'smart-mode-line)
(setq powerline-arrow-shape 'curve)
(setq powerline-default-separator-dir '(right . left))
(setq sml/theme 'powerline)

#+end_src

There are too much information cluttered at the bottom. I disable the
display of minor modes, there are just too many and almost all are
irrelevant.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(rich-minority-mode 1)
(setf rm-blacklist "")
#+end_src

This will leave empty spaces which can be removed by 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent

Finally, show the current time in the mode-line.

*** Multi-Cursor & Helm-swoop  - Multiple Selection 
[2015-01-19 Mon 12:10]
    
When refactoring code, I need to rename a variable or function names,
the normal way to do that is via searching and replacing.
=multiple-cursors= provides function to select all the words/symbols
that is highlighted and then modify all of them at the same time. 


#+begin_src emacs-lisp

;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-<") 'mc/mark-all-like-this)
#+end_src

I usually use =multi-cursor= with =helm-swoop=, which allows me to search, and then narrow down all
the occurrences in a temporary buffer, and then start to edit.

Instead of moving into the place I want, ace-jump provides a way to

can be a character, line, or word. Personally I found it is really

*** Expand-Region - Incremental Selection
[2015-01-20 Tue 07:47]
    
[[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] provides smart way of sectioning, by expanding the scope
one at a time. for example, 
#+begin_example
S = "A B C"
#+end_example
If the cursor in inside of the quote, I press ~C-=~, everything inside
of the quote is selected, press it again, the quotes are also
selected, press it again, the whole line/region is selected. It saves
a lot of keystrokes in highlighting the area. 

It works well with /smartparens/ mode, if I want to apply markup
syntax around a word, I press ~C-=~ to select it, then insert quote or
forward slash, the whole word will be warped inside of quote or
forward flash.

*** Alternative to shell 
[2015-01-28 Wed 07:46]

For the file management tasks like rename and delete, I'd like to
wrapper it as a Lisp function and call it directly in Emacs. 

Rename the buffer-visiting file, and also rename the buffer. Similar
to the /save as/ idea but will remove the older file. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
;; rename current buffer-visiting file
(defun yt/rename-current-buffer-file ()
  "Renames current buffer and file it is visiting."
  (interactive)
  (let ((name (buffer-name))
        (filename (buffer-file-name)))
    (if (not (and filename (file-exists-p filename)))
        (error "Buffer '%s' is not visiting a file!" name)
      (let ((new-name (read-file-name "New name: " filename)))
        (if (get-buffer new-name)
            (error "A buffer named '%s' already exists!" new-name)
          (rename-file filename new-name 1)
          (rename-buffer new-name)
          (set-visited-file-name new-name)
          (set-buffer-modified-p nil)
          (message "File '%s' successfully renamed to '%s'"
                   name (file-name-nondirectory new-name)))))))

#+end_src

Another useful Lisp function is to copy the file path to clipboard for
cross reference. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
;; full path of current buffer
(defun yt/copy-full-path-to-kill-ring ()
  "copy buffer's full path to kill ring"
  (interactive)
  (when buffer-file-name
    (let* ((file-truename buffer-file-name)
	   (rel-name (file-relative-name file-truename "~/")))  ; BUG: if filename is not relative to home directory.
      (kill-new (concat "~/" rel-name)))))
#+end_src

Open a file as a rooter in Emacs, very handy. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defun yt/sudo-find-file (file-name)
  "Like find file, but opens the file as root."
  (interactive "FSudo Find File: ")
  (let ((tramp-file-name (concat "/sudo::" (expand-file-name file-name))))
    (find-file tramp-file-name))) 
#+end_src

Find out the last modified date for current buffer, I need this often
when updating a blog post or documents. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defun yt/last-updated-date ()
  "return modification time of current file-visitng buffer"
  (interactive)
  (let* ((mtime (visited-file-modtime))) 
    (unless (integerp mtime)
      (concat "/Last UPdated/: "
              (format-time-string "%d %b %Y" mtime)))))
#+end_src

Remove current buffer-visiting file, and kill the buffer. I use this
function often in testing and trying out. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defun yt/delete-this-buffer-and-file ()
  "Removes file connected to current buffer and kills buffer."
  (interactive)
  (let ((filename (buffer-file-name))
        (buffer (current-buffer))
        (name (buffer-name)))
    (if (not (and filename (file-exists-p filename)))
        (error "Buffer '%s' is not visiting a file!" name)
      (when (yes-or-no-p "Are you sure you want to remove this file? ")
        (delete-file filename)
        (kill-buffer buffer)
        (message "File '%s' successfully removed" filename)))))
#+end_src

It is a good practise to group all the file management related
commands together using hydra. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defhydra hydra-file-management (:color red
                                        :hint nil)

  ("g" yt/git-up))
(global-set-key [f3] 'hydra-file-management/body)
#+end_src

Open the file manager at the default directory.

*** Projectile - Directory Access 
[2015-01-19 Mon 12:08]

/Projectile/ is an powerful Emacs package but I only use /projectile/
to jump between different git folders, so there isn't much
configuration except using =helm= for selection.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'projectile)
(helm-projectile-on)
(require 'helm-projectile)
(projectile-global-mode)
(setq projectile-enable-caching t)
(setq projectile-switch-project-action 'projectile-dired)
(setq projectile-remember-window-configs t )
(setq projectile-completion-system 'helm)
(setq projectile-switch-project-action 'helm-projectile)
(setq projectile-project-root-files-bottom-up '(".git" ".projectile")) ;; .projectile comes first
#+end_src

There are many things work out of box. For example, use =C-p p= to
choose which project to jump to, but I can type =M-g= to invoke Magit
or =M-e= to invoke Eshell for that project. 

*** Remote (SSH)
[2015-01-22 Thu 23:11]

I can work on the remote files in Emacs via ssh or tramp, both are
build-in packages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(require 'tramp)
(require 'ssh)
#+end_src

I'd like catch the password so that I don't need to type it every time
to open a file. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(setq password-cache-expiry nil)
#+end_src

I mainly run R on a remote machine. Sometimes I want to copy the
charts I created to local to include them in my report. This workfow
is suspended because it fails when the file size is large. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (defun yt/sync-local-remote ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   "copy all files in remote:~/LR_share to local:~/LR_share,

I use git and Github a lot, and usually in =shell-mode=, but I just
can't remember all the commands. Magit provides an interface to Git,
and it is really pleasant to use. So I don't need to remmeber all the
commands, also it comes with excellent [[http://magit.github.io/master/magit.html][manual]] and [[http://daemianmack.com/magit-cheatsheet.html][cheatsheet]].

# I use Emacs/org-mode as a unified system to do everything, at home and
# in the office. I used to use Dropbox/Copy to
# automatically sync the files on multiple machines, but this work-flow
# can be dangerous. Image if I was editing same files on two machines at
# the same time, then I can't track which is which.
    
# The good thing about Git is that you can see what exactlly has been
# changed by each version, and auto log, with commit information and
# timesatmp. Magit helps me to do it conviently but I need 3 more
# features:

# 1. automatically save all the buffers
   
Occasionally my office machine goes down because I run R with big
data, and it consumes all the memory. If that happens, I
potentially lose the newsiest version of scripts, which is bit
annoy. The following snippets will save all buffers in every hours.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defun yt/save-all-buffers ()
  "save all files-visiting buffers without user confirmation"
  (interactive)
  (save-some-buffers t nil)
  (message "save all buffers... done"))
(run-at-time "05:59" 3600 'yt/save-all-buffers)
#+end_src

Sometimes I have to leave at the last minutes, then what I do is call
a functions that commits and upload to the repo so that I can
continue work at home.

The =yt/git-up= function will do
   1. pull from the remote repo, and make sure the local repo is always
      up-to-date.
   2. add everything and commit with a timesamp.
   3. push local changes to the remote repo.
      
Here is the snippets.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defun yt/git-backup ()
  (let ((git-sh-scripts "
echo Start to Sync: $(date) 

REPOS=\"org jbarm\"
for REPO in $REPOS
do
    echo
    echo \"Repository: $REPO\"
    cd ~/git/$REPO
    # update
    git pull 
    # Remove deleted files
    git ls-files --deleted -z | xargs -0 git rm >/dev/null 2>&1
    # Add new files
    git add -A . >/dev/null 2>&1
    git commit -m \"$(date)\"
    git push origin master 
done

echo Finished Sync: $(date)
"))

  (message "all git sync... done"))

(defun yt/git-up ()
  (interactive)
  (yt/save-all-buffers)
  (yt/git-backup))
#+end_src

  
Few times I did some important work over the weenend, but once I
arrived office I realised I forgot uploading, These situations are
quick frustrating. The following snippets will start to uploads once
every three hours on my MacbookPro, but I don't use it anymore, since
I can get most of my work done in the office. 

Note this workflow is suspended for it's unsafe.

As Statistician, coding in R and writing report is what I do most of
the day. I have been though a long way of searching the perfect editor
for me, tried Rstudio, SublimeText, TextMate and settled down happily
with ESS/Emacs, for both coding and writing.
   
There three features that have me made the decision:
   
1) Auto Formatting 
   
   Scientists has reputation of being bad programmers, who wrote the
   code that is unreadable and therefore incomprehensible to others. I
   have intention to become top level programmer and followed a style
   guide strictly. It means I have to spent sometime in adding and
   removing space in the code.
   
   To my surprise, Emacs will do it for me automatically, just by
   hitting the TAB and it also indent smartly, which make me
   conformable to write long function call and split it into multiple
   lines. Here's an example. Also if I miss placed a ')' or ']' the
   formatting will become strange and it reminders me to check.
   
   #+begin_src R :eval no
   rainfall.subset <- data.table(rainfall.london,
                                rainfall.pairs,
                                rainfall.dublin)
   #+end_src
   
2) Search Command History
   
   I frequently search the command history. Imaging I was produce a
   plot and I realised there was something miss in the data, so I go
   back and fix the data first, then run the ggplot command again, I
   press Up/Down bottom many times, or just search once/two times.
   =M-x ggplot(= will gives me the most recent command I typed
   containing the keyword /ggplot(/, then I press =RET= to select the
   command, which might be =ggplot(gg.df, aes(lon, lat, col = city)) +
   geom_line() + .....=. If it is not I want, I press =C-r= again to
   choose the second most recent one and repeat until I find right
   one.
   
3) Literate Programming 
   
   I am an supporter of literate statistical analysis and believe we
   should put code, results and discoveries together in developing
   models. Rstudio provides an easy to use tool for this purpose, but
   it does not support different R sessions, so if I need to generate
   a report, I have to re-run all the code from beginning, which isn't
   particle for me with volumes data because it will take quit long.
   
   ESS and org-mode works really well via Babel, which is more
   friendly to use. I can choose to run only part of the code and have
   the output being inserted automatically, no need to copy/paste.
   Also, I can choose where to execute the code, on my local machine
   or the remote server, or both at the same time.
   
   These are only the surface of ESS and there are lot more useful
   features like spell checking for comments and documentation templates,
   that makes me productive and I would recommend anyone use R to learn
   ESS/Emacs. The following is my current setting.

*** Syntax highlight 

In Emacs, syntax highlighting is known as font-locking.  You can customize the amount of syntax highlighting that you want to see.  At the top of the Emacs window, click on the ESS menu and select "Font Lock".  This will display a menu of buttons corresponding to language elements that you can syntax highlight.

*** Programming Mode 
After 2014, Emacs comes a prog-mode, for programming langauge.  it is generic mode, just like text-mode, that sits underneth all the programming language, either R, phython, C++ etc.  The good thinkg to have this concept is that we can define few things that will apply to all these mode, when we write scripts.  
    
One thing I find particulaar usefull and necessary is to highliht  characters in comments that has particullar meaning, like TODO, FIXME or other.  which can be particular handy in code reivew, I can navite and jump between the code quickly. 
    
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent

we usually have long scripts, and in Subimetext, one cold folder and unfolder a function. in Emacs, this feature could be extended to furture, by define folder-characters.  at this statge, I tented to used the deafault, I.e. folder functions only.  in the folliwng setting, I could press =F3= to folder/unfolder a function, =C-F3= or =S-F3= to folder/unfolder all functions. 
    
one potentially solution is to use =org-strct-mode=, to show/hide the whole section, I havne;t tryied it before, but it sounds a good idea.

*** Spell and Grammar
[2015-01-23 Fri 17:43]

Spell checking and correcting are essential in writing. Emacs need
third party program do this. There are a couple of programs and I use
=aspell=. It is part of GNU and can be easily installed in OS X and
Ubuntu. The following snippet tells Emacs where =aspell= is installed
and use British dictionary. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(if (eq system-type 'darwin)
    (setq ispell-program-name "/usr/local/bin/aspell")
  (setq ispell-program-name "/usr/bin/aspell"))
(setq ispell-dictionary "british"
      ispell-extra-args '() ;; TeX mode "-t"
      ispell-silently-savep t)
#+end_src

I have a personal spelling dictionary, most are abbreviations and
jargon. I can tell aspell that they are not misspellings. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(setq ispell-personal-dictionary "~/git/.emacs.d/personal/ispell-dict") ;; add personal dictionary 
#+end_src


#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '(":\\(PROPERTIES\\|LOGBOOK\\):" . ":END:"))
(add-to-list 'ispell-skip-region-alist '("#\\+BEGIN_SRC" . "#\\+END_SRC"))
#+end_src

=Flyspell= depends on ispell mode and enables on-the-fly spell
checking/correcting. I enable the flyspell mode for text-mode and
org-mode. 

By default, I use C-, to move the cursor to the next misspelled word,
and =flycheck= will provide a list of candidates for
auto-correlection. I press =C-.= select the first one, and press it
again to select the next one.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
#+end_src 

I need an grammar check to let me know that 

#+begin_example
Have you do ...
#+end_example

is wrong, and also tell me to change /do/ to /done/, and also why.
=langtool= can do be the job, but currently I don't understand how to
get it works, so I am not using it anymore.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no

I started to learn Emacs by reading Bernt Hansen's [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Org Mode - Organize
Your Life In Plain Text!]] .My settings based on Bernt's 

associate org-mode with file with .org, .org_archive, and .txt

*** org-todos
[2015-07-20 Mon 14:57]

First, define the TODO keywords. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(setq org-todo-keywords
      (quote ((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "SOMEDAY" "ORG(o@/!)" "|" "DONE(d)")
              (sequence "WAITING(w@/!)" "HOLD(h@/!)" "|" "CANCELLED(c@/!)" "MEETING"))))
#+end_src

Then highlight the keywords using different colours. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(setq org-todo-keyword-faces
      (quote (("TODO" :foreground "red" :weight bold)
	      ("NEXT" :foreground "blue" :weight bold)
	      ("ORG" :foreground "blue" :weight bold)
              ("DONE" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold)
              ("WAITING" :foreground "orange" :weight bold)
              ("HOLD" :foreground "magenta" :weight bold)
              ("CANCELLED" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold)
              ("MEETING" :foreground "forest green" :weight bold))))
#+end_src

Define an event when a TODO status changes, for example, if changed to
HOLD, add HOLD tag and remove WAITING tag. If changed to DONE, remove
both HOLD and WAITING tags. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(setq org-todo-state-tags-triggers
      (quote (("CANCELLED" ("CANCELLED" . t))
              ("WAITING" ("WAITING" . t))
              ("HOLD" ("WAITING") ("HOLD" . t))
              (done ("WAITING") ("HOLD"))
              ("TODO" ("WAITING") ("CANCELLED") ("HOLD"))
              ("NEXT" ("WAITING") ("CANCELLED") ("HOLD"))
              ("DONE" ("WAITING") ("CANCELLED") ("HOLD")))))
#+end_src

Especially, when a task is marked as DONE, a timestamp is added to
the LOGBOOK drawer.

is disabled before of the performance issues in OS X.

*** Publish for blogging 
[2015-07-20 Mon 16:39]

** Blogging with Jekyll

Jeklly have few conventins, like the new, YAML etc, it is better to
solve it autoamtilcally and in Emacs, as part of the export process.


First, define a publish project, so that the exported html file will
go to certail place, and we can define the styles, and other features
for a praticularlly project. but for Jeklly, it is more about to match
the constraints.

For managing a blog, it is good idea to keep the original org file
inside of the website.  Most people using Jeklly write blog in
Markdown format, but Org-mode is obvious more powerful in Literate
Program. In this case, I have two folders under Jeklly project
direcotyr, org/_drafts and org/_posts. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defvar jekyll-directory (expand-file-name "~/git/myblog/org/")
  "Path to Jekyll blog.")
(defvar jekyll-drafts-dir "_drafts/"
  "Relative path to drafts directory.")
(defvar jekyll-posts-dir "_posts/"
  "Relative path to posts directory.")
(defvar jekyll-post-ext ".org"
  "File extension of Jekyll posts.")
#+end_src

I can quickly scne the folder to see how many outstanding drasfts and
which posts is published in in cease I need to edit it. I bind it to
=C-c j p= and =C-c j d= where /j/ means Jekly, /p/ means posts, and
/d/ means drafts. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c j p") (lambda ()
                                  (interactive)
                                  (find-file "~/git/myblog/org/_posts/")))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c j d") (lambda ()
                                  (interactive)
                                  (find-file "~/git/myblog/org/_drafts/")))
#+end_src

Jeklyl has a spacial template that requires to add YAML in the front,
since it is in org-mode, I can call Babel functions, add table of
contents and others etc. This is the template I am using. Note the
jekly-ymal-escape function is used just to make sure there is strange
characters that jeklly don;t like. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defvar jekyll-post-template
  " 
,#+BEGIN_HTML

  "Default template for Jekyll posts. %s will be replace by the post title.")

(defun jekyll-yaml-escape (s)
  "Escape a string for YAML."
  (if (or (string-match ":" s)
        2  (string-match "\"" s))
      (concat "\"" (replace-regexp-in-string "\"" "\\\\\"" s) "\"")
    s))
#+end_src

Then in starting a blog post, I fill the title, and there file will be
served in the org/_drafts folder, and insert the YMAL. Note in jeklly,
the title be part of html file name and therefore part of the URL. So
strange characters must been removed. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defun blog-draft-post (title) 
  "Create a new Jekyll blog post."
  (interactive "sPost Title: ")
  (let ((draft-file (concat jekyll-directory jekyll-drafts-dir
                            (jekyll-make-slug title)
                            jekyll-post-ext)))
    (if (file-exists-p draft-file)
        (find-file draft-file)
      (find-file draft-file)
      (insert (format jekyll-post-template (jekyll-yaml-escape title))))))

(defun jekyll-make-slug (s)
  "Turn a string into a slug."
  (replace-regexp-in-string
   " " "-" (downcase
            (replace-regexp-in-string
             "[^A-Za-z0-9 ]" "" s))))


#+end_src

Once I think the article is read to be publish, the
=blog-publish-post= function will move the editing draft into
org/_posts folder and prepend the file name with today's date in
%Y-%m-%d format. it is required by Jeklly.  

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(defun blog-publish-post ()
  "Move a draft post to the posts directory, and rename it so that it
 contains the date."
  (interactive)
  (cond
   ((not (equal
          (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)))
          (concat jekyll-directory jekyll-drafts-dir)))
    (message "This is not a draft post."))
   ((buffer-modified-p)
    (message "Can't publish post; buffer has modifications."))
   (t
    (let ((filename
           (concat jekyll-directory jekyll-posts-dir
                   (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d-")
                   (file-name-nondirectory
                    (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)))))
          (old-point (point)))
      (rename-file (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))
                   filename)
      (kill-buffer nil)
      (find-file filename)
      (set-window-point (selected-window) old-point)))))
#+end_src

I bound ~C-c j n~ and ~C-c j P~ for making a draft and publishing a draft. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent 
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c j n") 'blog-draft-post)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c j P") 'blog-publish-post)
#+end_src

Then convert all the org files in org/_posts into HTML and save in the
_posts/ folder. It is good to define an org-publish-project to
automate this. Note in the following, the published HTML has body
only, and without TOC, which are again, required by JEKLLY.

*** Path Issues 

When publishing, the org-file is firstly exported to html file, and when Jekyll build the website, the html file will be saved in to some folder that depends on the YMAL. Then the relative path to image files are broken. To solve that, according to the Jeklyy web site, is to save all the image or downloade files in assets/ folder.  Then those image files are referende by org-mode. 

First, define a img link, that when exporting, the image a_img.png will be set to linked to /assets/a_img.png. when I click, it wil open the img file in Emacs.

The advantage of use Emacs as an email client:
   
1. communication happens at the point where the content is genreated. 
   as a statisician/programmer, most likely I need to mmunicate with
   numbers, table, graphs, or snippet. I could just copy these results
   from to email, do an quickly editing.
2. HTML email with CSS style.  
   I like to formate my email use headingline, fonts, and highlhgit
   the code, I used to be write a report in Word/LatEx and write an
   email with only onbe line, please see the attachment. which I don't
   like.
3. search properly 
   I use search all the time, and this functionality is not working at
   all in outlkooik 2013, it also shows up random info (mail.app in
   osx did a great job).
   
Disadvantage and the things it can't do:
1. book Meeting/Appointment 
   I didn't aware that you can do it in emacs, and we need an
   iterative way to do. Outlook Schedule Asistant do a good job, it
   list agenda of all attendence, and I could spot oen time slot that
   suit for all or most people.
2. don't expect me to reply immediately 
   this is how does it works: 1. download the email from server, 2)
   index with head, body, attachment, user name etc. 3) Emacs talk to
   and show in GUI. I usually update the meail about 30 imnutes. but I
   helps me out of disrupts.
3. calendar 
   I don't know how to integrate Office 365 calendar with Org-mode
   calandar yet. even it can, I doubt I can download and see other
   people's agenda.

This setting need two programms to work: 1) mu, 2) offlineimap. 

To install /mu/ on osx, 

The basical workflow is: 
1. offlineimap download the Emails from server,
2. /mu/ index them, 
3. and /mu4e/ package render the emails in Emacs.
4. smtpmail for senting out emails.

I am trying to avoid use =C-x m= to write/sent email directy, unless
it is really short. otherwise, if it relates to a project, I will make
an org headline to keep track the project communciation, to do that, I
compose email/message in org mode, then sent the whole subtree by =C-c
M-o=.

*Attach and Inline Image* 
I got an email from an estate agency where there are few images are inlined, but also in the attachment.  why not just save the attachment online and inline the image as a normal HTML do? 

1) add an png attachment, display it as inline image.  

*Render LaTeX code as image*
currently it is broken.  the error message is the path issues, and seems the file is not generated.
