** This configuration is ... 
[2015-06-14 Sun 13:49]
1. self-contained. all the package needed for this configuration
   will be installed automatically from main Emacs package repo, except
   for mu4e
2. tryout friendly. anyone can have an try of this Emacs configuration
   without pollute yours
3. fully tested on Linux and OS X and update setting and packages frequently
4. including problematic settings are turned off temperately. 


* TODO This configration does not include
[2015-05-21 Thu 09:07]

1. few third party software, like mu, ispell, plantuml. However they
   can be installed within few mins
2. optimise start-up time, it takes about 3 seconds to start, which is
   fine for most Emacs-user who rarely re-start Emacs
3. use-package to solve dependence. I have full understanding the
   dependence among all the packages.
